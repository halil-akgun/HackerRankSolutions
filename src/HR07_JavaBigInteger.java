/*
In this problem, you have to add and multiply huge numbers! These numbers are so big that you can't contain
them in any ordinary data types like a long integer.
Use the power of Java's BigInteger class and solve this problem.
Input Format
There will be two lines containing two numbers, a and b.
Constraints
a and b are non-negative integers and can have maximum 200 digits.
Output Format
Output two lines. The first line should contain a + b, and the second line should contain a x b. Don't print any leading zeros.
Sample Input
1234
20
Sample Output
1254
24680
Explanation
1234 + 20 = 1254
1234 x 20 = 24680
